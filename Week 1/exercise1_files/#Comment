Code not perfect.

Main algorith (else part) won't catch
instances wherein the insertAt function calls the last element of a function. 

Was only looped until length-1 but it needed to loop until length for it to work in stack and queue algorithms,


had segmentation fault because it cannot access the top of the stack and element to be dequeued.
